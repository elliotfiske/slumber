<h1>PROPOSAL</h1>
SLUMBER has a very simple concept - the user is stuck in a state of sleep paralysis and can only look around the room.  The driving concept that I like to follow in horror is that stuff is only scary if you can't really see it.  Thus, users will 'lose' if they look at the monster for too long.  However, they are forced to be constantly be looking around the room to collect the 'collectibles,' small white trinkets that slightly restore the user's health.  I aim to create an interesting tension where the user HAS to look around the room, but really doesn't want to because they'll see spooky stuff.

<h1>TECHNOLOGIES</h1>
This is an interesting project in its straightforwardness - we have to take 1 room 'scene' and make it look as realistic as possible.  I plan to accomplish this with HD textures, realistic lighting + shadows and particle effects.  We can implement other interesting things like mirrors, 'light rays' (i.e. the moon shining into the room) and other interesting things like giving objects physics and throwing them around the room, etc.
<br>
<br>
Other considerations:  Oculus Rift support, high-fidelity audio/music, potential for multiplayer?
